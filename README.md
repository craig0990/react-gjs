# React GJS

> A React reconciler implementation for GTK-in-GJS

## What is it?

An experimental implementation of a React reconciler / renderer for GJS.

Instead of this:

```javascript
const box = new Gtk.Box()
const label = new Gtk.Label({ label: 'Hello, world!' })

box.append(label)
```

You can write:

```jsx
<box>
  <label label="Hello, world!" />
</box>
```

Most of the hard-work is powered by GJS support for ES modules, and the
`react-reconciler` package. This repository is essentially a collection of glue
code to connect the reconciler internals to the GTK bindings exposed by GJS.

### Again?

I know this has been tried before. The motivator here is:

(It's a fun challenge, obviously, but mainly...)

- GJS has recently added ES module support
- "Real" ES modules removed the need for arcance Webpack config compared to the
  last time I tried this
- Real ES modules + the Rollup bundler for "ES6 in <--> ES6 out" works so well
  that it actually feels pretty close to web-dev land
- Hopefully if a resolver implementation comes soon, we can even remove the
  Rollup build step

My longer-term hope is that this will work on Linux-powered phones with the
Phosh shell, but I'm still waiting for my hardware.

## Is it production-ready?

Currently? Absolutely not.

## How does it work?

There are two packages, managed as NPM workspaces in `packages/`.

- `@react-gjs/core` contains the reconciler implementation(s)
- `@react-gjs/polyfill` will eventually polyfill missing implementations of
  those functions defined by the
  [React Native JavaScript Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/javascript-environment),
  unless they get up-streamed

### Core Reconciler

The `core` package contains a `reconciler/core.ts` implementation, which is
concerned _only_ with instantiating `<someElement>` (see the
[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#user-defined-components-must-be-capitalized))
into a `Gtk.SomeElement` and attaching it to the screen. The root container for
the reconciler is expected to be a `Gtk.ApplicationWindow`.

It (ab)uses the `Gtk.Buildable` interface to be able to consistently call
`vfunc_add_child`, similar to the web DOM approach of `appendChild`.

I am trying to avoid a wrapper class for every possible GTK widget. The biggest
stumbling block at the moment is that `Gtk.StackPage` doesn't seem to implement
`Buildable` - there are probably others. It can be made to work with refs, but
it's not the nicest syntax to look at.

Since it uses `react-reconciler`, all the hard work for user-defined class
components, refs, hooks, state, etc. is managed by `react-reconciler` or React
itself. We get it for free.

### GTK Props Reconciler

The Core Reconciler works, but if you want to use a `LayoutManager`, or connect
to Signals, you'll need to do so through refs, to get an instance of the
underlying `Gtk.Widget`.

The GTK Props Reconciler supports namespaced JSX props for making this a little
bit simpler.

This doesn't support using/adding an `EventController`, or the more complex
widget hierarchies like a `Gtk.StackPage` that doesn't quite support buildable
the way we want, but it's an improvement for very little extra code.

The hope is that "userland" libraries can make use of these primitives, plus
refs for more complex logic, and wrap them up into easy-to-use packages like
much of the React ecosystem.

#### `gtk:layout`

The `gtk:layout` prop expects an object, which will be applied to the widget's
associated `LayoutChild`:

```jsx
<grid hexpand={true} column-homogeneous={true}>
  <label label="0,0" gtk:layout={{ column: 0, row: 0 }} />
  <label label="1,0" gtk:layout={{ column: 1, row: 0 }} />
  <label label="0,1" gtk:layout={{ column: 0, row: 1 }} />
  <label label="1,1" gtk:layout={{ column: 1, row: 1 }} />
</grid>
```

#### `gtk:connect-${signal}`

Any prop beginning with `gtk:connect-` will be interpreted as a signal handler:

```jsx
<button label="Click me!" gtk:connect-clicked={() => print('Yay!')} />
```

### Sample App

There is an example app in `examples/com.example.react-gjs.Todo`. It uses
`rollup` to compile the typescript, and `babel` in combination with the
[`bare-import-rewrite`](https://github.com/cfware/babel-plugin-bare-import-rewrite/issues)
plugin to produce a build that is close to the original source code and can be
run with GJS (`gjs -m dist/(long-path)/index.js`).

## Getting Started

See also: the "What's Missing" section.

- `npm install`
- `npx tsc --build` build the core packages (add `--watch` for convenience)
- `cd examples/com.example.react-gjs.Todo && npx rollup -c rollup.config.js` to
  build the example app

The example app reproduces the source directory inside `dist/`, so it's:

```
$ cd examples/com.example.react-gjs.Todo
$ gjs -m dist/examples/com.example.react-gjs.Todo/index.js
```

## What's Missing?

So. Much. Stuff. ðŸ˜…

- Sensible build tooling scripts
- `EventController`
- `CssProvider`
- `<lots-more>`
- Actual polyfills, the polyfill package just stops it crashing on
  `setTimeout is not defined`
- Guarantees about signals being disconnected properly on re-renders (seems to
  be OK at the moment, although I actually expected the handlers to double up on
  re-render :shrug:)
- Full type safety - I am new to TypeScript, but I have a feeling typing JS-to-C
  bindings would be difficult even if I wasn't
- Sensible memory usage guarantees
- Meson packaging
- Tested GResource support when packaged
- Script for running in broadway with livereload (I have this working elsewhere,
  need to bring it in)

## Can I help?

Absolutely yes please. File an issue with a suggestion on what I've done wrong
or how I could improve it. Or send me an email (`github` [at]
`craig.<the-website-tld-in-my-profile>`) Send a Pull Request. Maybe don't report
a bug though - I already know 90% of GTK doesn't work ;)

There is no CLA - there's no prospect of re-licensing this under
GPL/proprietary, what would be the use? All the dependent libraries are
MIT-compatible anyway, as far as I can tell.

There's no style guide, or issue template, or any kind of hard rule since it's
not functional yet.

## License

If I've missed (or left at default) a license field in any of the `package.json`
files, for clarity: this is all MIT licensed.
